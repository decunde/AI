PART 3   EXECUTION
3.1	INSTALLATION
A.	The UPS shall be set in place, wired, and connected in accordance with the approved shop drawings and manufacturer's instructions.
//B.	In seismic areas, UPS shall be adequately anchored and braced per details on structural contract drawings to withstand the seismic forces at the location where installed.//
3.2	ACCEPTANCE CHECKS AND TESTS 
A.	An authorized representative of the UPS manufacturer shall technically supervise and participate during all of the field adjustments and tests. Major adjustments and field tests shall be witnessed by the //Resident Engineer// //COR//.  The manufacturer’s representative shall certify in writing that the equipment has been installed, adjusted, and tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
B.	Perform manufacturer’s required field tests in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  In addition, include the following:
1.	Visual Inspection and Tests:
a.	Compare equipment nameplate data with specifications and approved shop drawings.
b.	Inspect physical, electrical, and mechanical condition.
c.	Verify appropriate anchorage, required area clearances, and correct alignment.
d.	Verify tightness of accessible bolted electrical connections by calibrated torque-wrench method, or performing thermographic survey after energization.
e.	Verify grounding connections.
f.	Vacuum-clean enclosure interior.  Clean enclosure exterior.
g.	Verify the correct operation of all alarms and indicating devices.
h.	Attach a phase rotation meter to the UPS input, output, and bypass buses, and observe proper phase sequences.
i.	Check and test controls for proper operation.
j.	Check doors for proper alignment and operation.
k.	Check and test each protective device for proper mechanical and electrical operation.
//l.	Verify protective device overcurrent trip settings against approved coordination study.//
//m.	Confirm correct operation and sequencing of key-type mechanical interlock systems.//
2.	Load Test:  The UPS shall be load tested for a continuous 24 hour period by means of resistive load banks, sized for full rated output load and provided by the UPS manufacturer.  The UPS shall be continuously tested at 1/2 load for 8 hours, 3/4 load for 8 hours and full load for 8 hours.  If a failure occurs during the burn-in period, the tests shall be repeated.  Instrument readings shall be recorded every half hour for the following:
a.	Input voltage and current (all three phases, for each module).
b.	Input and output frequency.
c.	Battery voltage for each module.
d.	Output voltage and current (all three phases, for each module).
e.	Output kilowatts for each module.
f.	Output voltage and current (all three phases).
g.	Output kilowatts.
SPEC WRITER NOTE: Delete emergency source testing requirements if no emergency source is available.

3.	Full Load Burn In Test:  The UPS shall undergo an additional full load burn-in period of 24 continuous hours by means of resistive load banks, sized for full rated output load and provided by the UPS manufacturer.  If a failure occurs during the burn-in period, the tests shall be repeated.  Instrument readings shall be recorded every half hour as above.  The following tests shall be performed:
a.	With the UPS carrying full rated output load and supplied from the normal source, switch //100 percent// //50 percent// of load bank capacity on and off a minimum of five times within the burn-in period.
//b.	With the UPS carrying maximum continuous design load and supplied from the emergency source, repeat the switching operations described above.// 
4.	Full Load Battery Burn In Test:  The UPS shall undergo a full load battery test by means of resistive load banks, sized for full rated output load and provided by the UPS manufacturer. If a failure occurs during the battery discharge time, the tests shall be repeated.  Instrument readings shall be recorded every half hour as above.  
a.	With the UPS carrying full rated output load and operating on battery power, switch //100 percent// //50 percent// of load bank capacity on and off a minimum of five times within the battery discharge time.
5.	Battery Discharge and Recharge Test:  With the battery fully charged, the UPS shall undergo a complete battery discharge test to full depletion followed by a full recharge.  Instrument readings shall be recorded every minute during discharge for the following:
a.	Battery voltage and current// for each module//.
b.	Output voltage and current (all three phases)// for each module//.
c.	Output kilowatts// for each module//.
d.	Output voltage and current (all three phases).
e.	Output kilowatts (system).
f.	Output frequency.
3.3 FOLLOW-UP VERIFICATION
A.	After completion of acceptance checks and tests, the Contractor shall show by demonstration in service that the UPS is in good operating condition and properly performing the intended function.  
3.4 ONE LINE DIAGRAM AND SEQUENCE OF OPERATION
A.	At final inspection, an as built one line diagram shall be laminated or mounted under acrylic glass, and installed in a frame mounted near the UPS.
B.	Furnish a written sequence of operation for the UPS and connected line side/load side electrical distribution equipment.  The sequence of operation shall be laminated or mounted under acrylic glass, and installed in a frame mounted near the UPS. 
C.	Deliver an additional four copies of the as-built one line diagram and sequence of operation to the //Resident Engineer// //COR//.
3.5 INSTRUCTION
A.	Furnish the services of a factory trained technician for one 4 hour training period for instructing personnel in the maintenance and operation of the UPS, on the dates requested by the //Resident Engineer// //COR//
